# Compodoc Documentation

## ðŸŒŸWhat is Compodoc?

Compodoc, specifically crafted for Angular projects, functions as a documentation tool. When prompted by the CLI, choosing to integrate Compodoc typically entails generating documentation for your Angular project using this tool. The resulting documentation is static and aims to comprehensively cover the core APIs of Angular, encompassing modules, components, injectables, routes, directives, pipes, and standard classes.

## ðŸŒŸWhy to use Compodoc documentation?

Compodoc assists Angular developers in creating clear and beneficial documentation for their applications. This documentation enables other team members or visitors to comprehend the application's features easily, whether for internal collaboration or public reference.

## ðŸŒŸStep by Step procedure to Implement

1. Install Required Packages: Begin by installing the necessary packages, including Compodoc, in your project.

```javascript
npm install -D @compodoc/compodoc
```

2. Include Component Files: Ensure that your component files are included in the TypeScript compilation for Compodoc. Adjust your tsconfig.json file to specify the paths to the component files.

```javascript
{
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

3. Enable Compodoc and Configure: Update your project's configuration to enable Compodoc and configure it as needed. Adjust settings such as export format and output directory in your project's configuration file.

4. Inform Storybook of Documentation File: Let Storybook know the location of the documentation.json file generated by Compodoc. Import the documentation.json file in your Storybook setup file using the appropriate method provided by Storybook's addon-docs package.

```javascript
import { setCompodocJson } from "@storybook/addon-docs/angular";
import compodocJson from "../documentation.json";

setCompodocJson(compodocJson);
```

5. Set Up Autodocs: Enable autodocs in your Storybook configuration to ensure that documentation is included and displayed properly in the Docs tab.

6. Run Storybook: Once configured, run Storybook to see the documentation integrated into the Docs tab.

```javascript
npm run storybook
```

By following these steps, one can set up documentation generation with Compodoc and integrate it into Storybook for the JavaScript project. Adjustments may be needed based on your project's specific setup and requirements.
