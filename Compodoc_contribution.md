## üìò All about Storybook

Storybook is like a workshop for frontend developers where they can build, test, and showcase individual pieces of a website or app (called UI components) without needing to put them together in the entire project. It helps developers work on these pieces faster and more easily, making sure they look and behave as intended before putting them into the final project. Storybook boasts an active and vibrant community of developers who contribute to its development, share knowledge, and provide support through platforms like GitHub Discussions, Discord, blogging, and social media channels. Storybook receives support from sponsors and backers who contribute financially to the project's development and maintenance. It also operates under the MIT license, allowing for widespread adoption and usage.

Supported Frameworks of Storybook which supports multiple frontend frameworks are React, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte, Ember, Preact, and others. It also extends support to mobile development frameworks like React Native and native mobile platforms like Android, iOS, and Flutter.

## üîç Detailed Explanation of Issue

The problem described in the issue is related to the lack of clear documentation regarding the usage of Compodoc within a Command Line Interface (CLI). When users encounter this prompt within the CLI, asking if they want to use Compodoc, they express a need for more detailed information on what Compodoc does and how it integrates with the project workflow as, this is an angular project.

The provided links offer additional context by directing to a Stack Overflow question discussing the utilization of Compodoc for Storybook documentation. This implies that the users seek clarity on how Compodoc can be utilized in conjunction with Storybook.

## ‚úÖ Work Done

To contribute to an open-source project of community code part 1:

- I Forked and cloned the project to my machine.
- After that, I establish a new branch with name compodoc_info to work upon the issue.
- Did research about compodoc documentation for angular projects which provided as references.
- Then after, I create a file with name "compodoc_readme.md" and add everything relevant to the topic along with the forked repo and issue link.
- Then I commit and push all the content to GitHub.

## üåüCode Review and Outcome

The documentation got reviewed by Baljit Singh, and he told me to add a section in my readme which describes some "Real-world examples" who uses compodoc documentation for the Angular projects which , I added now.

## üåü Reflection on Success

Upon successful completion of this issue, I gained some useful knowledge regarding a completely new topic Although, this is a documentation issue but, this needs a lot of research as, this topic is completely new to me and requires time to work upon. Also, I learned the importance of clear documentation. This experience emphasized the significance of seeking clarification, and advocating for change to drive positive outcomes and enhance the user experience.

## üåüNext steps

As I gain knowledge on this topic, my curiosity drives me to seek further understanding through additional research. Furthermore, I aim to put it into practice to observe its practical outcomes firsthand.
